    "### Side Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "People use GPUs to do machine learning\n",
    "because they expect them to be fast.\n",
    "But transferring variables between contexts is slow.\n",
    "So we want you to be 100% certain\n",
    "that you want to do something slow before we let you do it.\n",
    "If the framework just did the copy automatically\n",
    "without crashing then you might not realize\n",
    "that you had written some slow code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, transferring data between devices (CPU, GPUs, other machines)\n",
    "is something that is *much slower* than computation.\n",
    "It also makes parallelization a lot more difficult,\n",
    "since we have to wait for data to be sent (or rather to be received)\n",
    "before we can proceed with more operations.\n",
    "This is why copy operations should be taken with great care.\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, many small operations\n",
    "are much worse than one big operation.\n",
    "Moreover, several operations at a time\n",
    "are much better than many single operations interspersed in the code\n",
    "(unless you know what you are doing)\n",
    "This is the case since such operations can block if one device\n",
    "has to wait for the other before it can do something else.\n",
    "It is a bit like ordering your coffee in a queue\n",
    "rather than pre-ordering it by phone\n",
    "and finding out that it is ready when you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, when we print tensors or convert tensors to the NumPy format,\n",
    "if the data is not in main memory,\n",
    "the framework will copy it to the main memory first,\n",

    "\n",
    "* We can specify devices for storage and calculation, such as CPU or GPU.\n",
    "  By default, data are created in the main memory\n",
    "  and then uses the CPU for calculations.\n",
    "* The framework requires all input data for calculation\n",
    "  to be *on the same device*,\n",
    "  be it CPU or the same GPU.\n",
    "* You can lose significant performance by moving data without care.\n",
    "  A typical mistake is as follows: computing the loss\n",
    "  for every minibatch on the GPU and reporting it back\n",
    "  to the user on the command line (or logging it in a NumPy array)\n",
    "  will trigger a global interpreter lock which stalls all GPUs.\n",
    "  It is much better to allocate memory\n",
    "  for logging inside the GPU and only move larger logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try a larger computation task, such as the multiplication of large matrices,\n",
    "   and see the difference in speed between the CPU and GPU.\n",
    "   What about a task with a small amount of calculations?\n",
    "1. How should we read and write model parameters on the GPU?\n",
    "1. Measure the time it takes to compute 1000\n",
    "   matrix-matrix multiplications of $100 \\times 100$ matrices\n",
    "   and log the matrix norm $\\mathrm{tr} M M^\\top$ one result at a time\n",
    "   vs. keeping a log on the GPU and transferring only the final result.\n",
    "1. Measure how much time it takes to perform two matrix-matrix multiplications\n",
    "   on two GPUs at the same time vs. in sequence\n",
    "   on one GPU (hint: you should see almost linear scaling).\n"
